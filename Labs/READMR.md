ABOUT THIS LAB

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that allows AWS customers to manage user access and permissions for their accounts, as well as available APIs/services within AWS. IAM can manage users and security credentials (such as API access keys), and allow users to access AWS resources.

In this lab, we will walk through the foundations of IAM. We'll focus on user and group management, as well as how to assign access to specific resources using IAM-managed policies. We'll learn how to find the login URL, where AWS users can log in to their account, and explore this from a real-world use case perspective.
